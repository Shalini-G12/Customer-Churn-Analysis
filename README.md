# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company. It involves data exploration, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict customer churn. The analysis provides valuable insights into factors influencing churn and enables the development of targeted retention strategies.
This repository contains the code and visualizations for a customer churn analysis and prediction project. The goal is to understand the factors influencing customer churn within a telecommunications company and build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Exploration:**
    * Data loading and initial exploration.
    * Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to identify key trends and relationships between features.

* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Feature engineering (if applicable).
    * Encoding categorical variables.
    * Scaling numerical features.

* **Machine Learning Model:**
    * Training a Random Forest Classifier model to predict customer churn.
    * Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    * Visualization of model performance using a confusion matrix.

* **Interactive Visualizations:**
    * Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.express for a more engaging and insightful analysis.
